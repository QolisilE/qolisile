### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
"I'm Qoli Ngoveni, The Geologist Turned Data Scientist.

You might be wondering why I transitioned from being a geologist to diving into the world of data science. The answer is simple: passion and curiosity.

In my previous role as a Junior Geologist at a mining company, I frequently dealt with databases containing thousands of rows of data. Managing such a large dataset and extracting meaningful insights was challenging. It was then that I realized I needed a more efficient way to handle this data. My curiosity led me to discover SQL, and after some research, I found a course on 'Relatioanal Databases and SQL' offered by Coursera. I took a chance, signed up for a free trial, and I was hooked. My journey into data science started from there, and before I knew it, I had earned a Data Science Professional Certificate. This shift wasn't plannedâ€”curiosity led the way.

I'm Reaching Out for Your Help!

This is me sending out an SOS. I'm actively seeking opportunities to kick-start my career as a certified Data Science professional. If you or someone you know can connect me with job opportunities, I would greatly appreciate the assistance. Please spread the wordâ€”I'm ready to take on my dream job!

My Skills:

Data Analysis,
Data Visualization,
Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Models,
Managing Relational Databases with Python and SQL
âš¡ Fun Fact: After Data Science, my second love is music. There's no mountain I wouldn't climb with my favorite tunes playing."
